            <h1>Learn As I Code</h1>
            <p>A simple website to show what I've learnt and how I've learnt it. Keep in mind, any descriptions are based of my understanding of things at the time of writing them. My understanding of things may change as I learn.</p>

            <h2>Day 1</h2>
            <p>Today I have learnt about HTML. HTML is short for HyperText Markup Language and that it is used on the frontend and is the structure of a website. It can be styled with CSS and made interactive with Java Script.</p>
            <p>HTML uses different "elements" in its code. The structure of the element is as seen below.</p>

            <h3>Tags I learnt today</h3>
            <p>The <strong>body</strong> tag is used to house the "body" of the website. Anything within the body tag will be shown on the website.</p>
            <p>The <strong>div</strong> tag is used to divide your code up into sections. This is especially useful when you want to change the attributes of an entire section without effecting anything else.</p>
            <p>The <strong>img</strong> tag is used to add pictures to a website. This can be done from an online database or from local storage using the src attribute. The img tag is an empty tag meaning it only has the opening tag and does not require a closing tag.</p>
            <p>The <strong>comment</strong> tag is a little different. It uses just an opening tag however the beginning of the tag starts with !-- and it finishes with -- and everything inbetween will be ignored when running the code. Comments allow you to add notes about code or even completely exclude lines of code if need be.</p>
            <p>The <strong>head</strong> tag contains information used by seach engines and the like.The <strong>head</strong> tag goes inbetween the opening <strong>html</strong> and <strong>body</strong> tags. Information in the <strong>head</strong> tag is not visible on the website.</p>
            <p>The <strong>title</strong> tag is used inside the <strong>head</strong> tag to give the website a "title" that search engines can recognize.</p>
            <p>The <strong>br</strong> tag is a "line break". When used, any text that comes after it will be on a new line.</p>

            <h3>Day 1 Closure</h3>
            <p>So far so good. Now I just need to learn how to add some style!</p>
